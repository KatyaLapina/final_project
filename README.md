## Machine Learning Model for Real Estate Listings
We have data from Yandex.Realty classified Yandex.Realty (https://realty.yandex.ru/) containing real estate listings for apartments in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast from 2016 till the middle of August 2018. In this Lab, you'll learn how to apply machine learning algorithms to solve business problems. Accurate price prediction can help to find fraudsters automatically and help Yandex.Realty users make better decisions when buying and selling real estate.

The cleaned and prepared dataset contains the following features:

1. last_price
2. floor
3. rooms
4. area
5. renovation
6. year
7. month

## ML model
Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGboost were tested. As the best one XGboost was chosen.

## Metrics for final model
